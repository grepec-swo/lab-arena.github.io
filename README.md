Project Context ‚Äì AccessGraph Cloud (One-Page Landing)
üß≠ Business Goals

Explain, in plain language, what ‚ÄúOpenFGA management‚Äù is and why it matters.

Get visitors to start a free trial or book a demo (single primary CTA).

Build quick trust with concise security notes and lightweight social proof.

Rank for a few core terms (e.g., ‚ÄúOpenFGA management SaaS‚Äù, ‚ÄúZanzibar-style auth‚Äù) with on-page SEO only.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack

Site type: Single static page (index.html) + one CSS + one JS file.

Styling: Tailwind via CDN or a small handcrafted CSS file (no build step).

Interactivity: Minimal vanilla JS (or Alpine.js via CDN) for mobile menu, FAQ accordion, pricing toggle.

Icons: Lucide/Heroicons via CDN.

Forms: Formspree (or GetForm/FormSubmit) for demo/contact capture‚Äîworks on GitHub Pages without a backend.

Analytics (optional): Cloudflare Web Analytics or Plausible (single script tag).

Deployment: GitHub Pages from main branch (/docs folder or root), no CI/CD required.

üß© Architecture & Structure

Header (sticky): Logo | ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù (anchors) | Pricing | FAQ | Docs link (to external OSS docs) | Start free (button).

Hero: Clear value prop (‚ÄúManaged OpenFGA control plane‚Äù), 1-sentence subhead, primary CTA (Start free), secondary (Book demo).

Problem ‚Üí Solution: Brief bullets on policy sprawl, brittle rules, low visibility ‚Üí how AccessGraph centralizes modeling, versioning, and audits.

Visual model & relation designer

Schema versioning & environment promotion

Playground & policy tests (explained, not run here)

Import/Export compatible with OpenFGA

Audit trails & ‚Äúwho can access what‚Äù reports

Multi-tenant projects & environments

‚ÄúHow it works‚Äù (3 steps): Model ‚Üí Connect SDKs ‚Üí Observe/Audit (tiny code block for SDK snippet).

Security note: Data handling, SSO/SOC 2 status (short, honest).

Pricing (simple): Starter, Team, Enterprise (feature checklist + monthly price, one CTA per tier).

FAQ: 6‚Äì8 questions (setup time, compatibility with OpenFGA, rate limits, data residency, support).

üîí Project Assumptions

Brand basics (logo, primary color, font choice) are available or acceptable to set minimally.

We can reference OpenFGA and show non-sensitive UI screenshots.

One locale (English) and a single domain (GitHub Pages URL or custom CNAME).

Legal copy (Privacy/Terms) provided or approved short-form templates are acceptable.

üß† Scope

Single responsive landing page with anchor navigation.

Copywriting: headline, subhead, feature blurbs, pricing, FAQ, security note.

Lightweight assets: 2‚Äì3 optimized screenshots and 1 small SVG illustration (optional).

Contact/demo form wired to Formspree (or equivalent).

On-page SEO: title/description tags, Open Graph/Twitter tags, canonical, basic schema.org.

Basic analytics script integration (optional toggle).

GitHub Pages setup instructions in README.md + favicon & social preview image.

‚öñÔ∏è Out of Scope

Multi-page site (no blog, docs hosting, or changelog pages).

A/B testing, experimentation, or automated tests.

Build tooling, bundlers, or design systems; no Next.js/React required.

Backend services, auth flows, or in-app product work.

Complex CMS, localization, or gated content.
